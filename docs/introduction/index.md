# What is Laravel Schedule Testing?

Laravel Schedule Testing, a **lightweight package for testing command schedules in Laravel**, was developed and is maintained by the developers at [Hatchet](https://hatchet.com.au).

Laravel offers a strong system for automating routine tasks with scheduled commands, but testing your schedule can be difficult. Without adequate testing tools, unexpected results and performance disruptions can occur.

We aim to simplify the testing process, offering a clear syntax to test all aspects of your command's scheduling.

With our package, you'll have the peace of mind that comes with knowing your commands are scheduled as intended. The accompanying documentation will walk you through the process of testing your commands.
